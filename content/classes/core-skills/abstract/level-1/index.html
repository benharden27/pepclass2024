<p>Abstracts are an integral part of your science. They are the most commonly read parts of papers, reporting clearly what was done and what you found. They also act as something of a calling card to advertise what kind of research you do. For the case of a scientific conference abstract, the content of your abstract will determine if you are accepted into a particular sessions, giving you the ability to talk or present your work to people in your field.</p>
<p>Like with research papers as a whole, there is differing opinion on what exactly should go into one and it will also depend on whether its an abstract reporting work completed in a paper or one being submitted to a conference. You will have heard a variety of ideas from the professional development session on abstract writing and itâ€™s from there that we will be gathering ideas so you know where to begin.</p>

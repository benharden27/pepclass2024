<p>Now that you have the basic elements of a introductory talk down, it’s time to get creative and build a presentation that really sparkles.</p>
<p>There are a few places where you can decide to focus your energy. You should discuss with me and pick one of the following that you should work on. We will then work together to revise your ideas.</p>
<div id="storytelling" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Storytelling</h2>
<p>Storytelling is something you hear referred to all the time when it comes to the theory of Environmental/Science communication. But just saying that your communication strategy should incorporate storytelling elements isn’t really enough, we need to understand what that means and what impacts different kinds of stories can have.</p>
<div id="basic-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Basic Plots</h3>
<p>The following video explains a theory popularized by Christopher Booker in his 2004 book: The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories. Booker was certainly not the first to talk about familiar patterns in stories, but this is the jumping off point we will use.</p>

<p>You can read more descriptions of these plots in <a href="https://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/basic-plots.html">this article</a> which also includes 2 extra plots that Booker doesn’t find gratifying for whatever reason (“Mystery” and "Rebellion Against ‘The One’).</p>

<div id="shapes-of-stories" class="section level3">
<h3>Shapes of Stories</h3>
<p>We can also imagine stories not just as a series of happenings to and decisions by a protagonist, but also in terms of the emotional highs and lows explicit in the story.</p>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut popularized the idea that we can think about the shapes of stories. Watch the short lecture below where he describes this theory.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/the-six-main-arcs-in-storytelling-identified-by-a-computer/490733/">this article</a> in The Atlantic summarizes <a href="The_emotional_arcs_of_stories_are_dominated_by_six.pdf">this paper</a> wherein the author’s tried to quantify the theories of story shape laid out by Kurt Vonnegut and come to pretty similar conclusions.</p>
<p>One of the key takeaways about storytelling is that stories are successful when people care about how they turn out. For your presentation, this means centering the “why should I care?” statement. Think about the importance of your topic and put that front and center to build your story around. This could involve starting our with a real world story about the impact of your topic, or it could involve setting up the stakes early about what might happen if we don’t fully understand a process in the ocean.</p>

<h2>2. Improved slides</h2>
<p>To give a really powerful talk, your slides should be true visual aids not just the notes that you are using to help remind you what to say. It’s important to find the right balance of information and images/diagrams so that the audience can follow what you are saying.</p>
<p>To create a good slide deck we need to include ideas from graphic design as well as understanding how people process information.</p>
<p>Starting with graphic design (something we’ll come back to when thinking about poster design), here is a short reading describing some of the basic elements to think about on your slide.</p>

<p>Specifically, to scientific slide design, here are some other thoughts that might help you shape how you put your ideas together on a slide.</p>

<div id="confident-engaging-delivery" class="section level2">
<h2>3. Confident, engaging delivery</h2>
<p>What is a presentation without a presenter? To be a successful presenter you need to be true to yourself, engage your audience, and deliver with confidence.</p>
<p>This article outlines some main ideas to think on:</p>

<p>Other than personal experimentation, one possible way to find out what your style is is to find speakers that you respect, analyze their presentation style and incorporate the bits that work for you into your style. TED talks are a good place to look around to compare presentation style. I’ve included a few here that range in topic and style, but your should feel empowered to find more or analyze other presenters. Ask questions like: what makes them successful? why was I so engaged? how did they make me feel included in the presentation?</p>

You've probably already given a number of presentations in your educational careers so far. Now it's time to hone some of these skills ahead of giving a talk about what you know about your summer research. 

## Presentation Preparation

In class we discussed making sure we are clear on who we are talking to and what your goals are for the presentation. 

For you mid-term presentation, your audience will be your PEP peers so you know you can assume a certain level of scientific understanding, but possibly not any prior knowledge of the specifics of the research topics you are investigating.

For your final presentation, the audience will be a little wider including some community members with less scientific background.

In both cases, your goal is to communicate clearly and compellingly the work that you have conducted this summer including your research questions, methods and main findings.

Before you put together either talk, its usually a good idea to organize the ideas you want to include for you given audience. As we discussed in class you could do this by consider answers to the following questions (although they wont necessarily get addressed in this order in the presentation)

### What are key scientific concepts and big ideas?

How far back do you need to step to make sure people know what your talking about? What are the key ideas/concepts you will need to make sure people are clear on before you can go far in your presentation

# What is known and not known about your research areas?

What is your research topic? What have people done before you in this field? What are we pretty sure of related to your research? What are the gaps in our understanding?

### Why should we care?

Related to either of the above points - what is important about this topic? Why study it? What can we achieve if we fill the gaps in knowledge? What are the implications for people and the planet?

### What question(s) are you seeking to answer?

Based on what isn't known in your field - what questions are you trying to answer? What are you hypotheses?

### How are you going to answer those questions?

What are your methods or research plan? How we you make sure you can answer the question you want to answer? What tools will you use?


## Scientific Presentation Overview

For Level 1, let's focus on some general skills. The following are some articles to read that give you some pointers on giving strong science presentations. Remember when reading these that much of this is just opinion - there are as many pieces of advice out there as there are people who've given presentations. Although there are studies that support certain things below, there is also just a lot of info out there about best practice and you might hear something that doesn't resonate with you. The best thing though, is practice itself. And learning from your mistakes.

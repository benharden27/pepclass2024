<p>You’ll have probably tired of hearing at this point that to move forward in a science or science-adjactent career, it’s all about meeting people and exploring opportunities that are presented. One way to ensure that you get a chance to explore new horizons and maximize the opportunities that come your way is to practice reaching out to people in field you find interesting.</p>
<p>For this level, you are going to write an email to someone that you have met briefly (or are interested in meeting) in Woods Hole. This could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone you’ve read papers from who is in your field</li>
<li>Someone who has given a talk in the PEP class</li>
<li>Someone who has given a talk in your department or other space in Woods Hole</li>
<li>Someone in a field in Woods Hole that you think sounds interesting</li>
<li>Anyone else that you think is interesting</li>
</ul>
<p>We will discuss in class how you will go about this email, but some general pointers we will look at include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell them clearly who you are, where you’re at in your science journey, and what your interests are</li>
<li>Do your research - if it’s someone who you’ve read papers from then be sure to note down what you thought was novel/interesting in their work. Also note down any questions you have about their results.</li>
<li>Be clear about what you are asking for - is it a chance to find out more about their work? Is it some specific answers to questions you are posing? Is it to have them comment on something you’re producing?</li>
<li>Be honest and genuine in your enthusiasm for what they do and relate it to your past work.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should write your email and then bcc me so that I can see who you wrote to and what you said so I can offer feedback.</p>

<p>Storytelling is something you hear referred to all the time when it comes to the theory of Environmental/Science communication. But just saying that your communication strategy should incorporate storytelling elements isn’t really enough, we need to understand what that means and what impacts different kinds of stories can have. That’s what this module will be all about.</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Let’s get started by looking at some readings on storytelling theory.</p>
<div id="basic-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Basic Plots</h3>
<p>The following video explains a theory popularized by Christopher Booker in his 2004 book: The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories. Booker was certainly not the first to talk about familiar patterns in stories, but this is the jumping off point we will use.</p>

<p>You can read more descriptions of these plots in <a href="https://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/basic-plots.html">this article</a> which also includes 2 extra plots that Booker doesn’t find gratifying for whatever reason (“Mystery” and "Rebellion Against ‘The One’).</p>

<h3>Shapes of Stories</h3>
<p>We can also imagine stories not just as a series of happenings to and decisions by a protagonist, but alos in terms of the emotional highs and lows explicit in the story.</p>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut popularized the idea that we can think about the shapes of stories. Watch the short lecture below where he describes this theory.</p>

<p>In addition, read <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/the-six-main-arcs-in-storytelling-identified-by-a-computer/490733/">this article</a> in The Atlantic summarizing <a href="The_emotional_arcs_of_stories_are_dominated_by_six.pdf">this paper</a> wherein the author’s tried to quantify the theories of story shape laid out by Kurt Vonnegut and come to pretty similar conclusions.</p>

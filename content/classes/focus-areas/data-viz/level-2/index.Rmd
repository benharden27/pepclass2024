```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

In Level 2 we're going to look at how to read in data and make some basic plots.

### Reading Data

If you've used Excel before, you'll be pretty familiar with the spreadsheet layout of data where we have rows and columns. Many datasets you'll be working with in R are also organized in the same way. R calls them data frames.

![Values are stored at intersection of rows (obserations) and columns (variables)](tidy_1.png)

Watch this brief intro to importing data into a data frame in R, and how it differs from using data in Excel.

## Plotting Data

The tool we are going to be using is the ggplot package. It's a powerful and flexible way to make graphics and it used widely by scientists analyzing data.

You should also go through [this primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.1) on visualization in R using ggplot. It includes interactive code chunks for you to try out the ideas as you go.

## A Walk-through

We're now going to apply your ggplot intro skills to a real ocean data set. Specifically, we're going to look at some ocean CTD profiles as this kind of data is going to be relevent to many of your projects.

We are going to be using data from a single CTD profile, You can download the data here: [SR04.csv](SR04.csv).

### Activating packages

So far, we've come across two packages: readr (the package we used to read in our csv file) and ggplot (to make plots). We are going to need both for this exercise because we are now going to be both reading and plotting data. Both come in the tidyverse package, but you need to activate them at the top of your script.

So make sure your script starts with the following:

```{r libraries}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
```

### Reading in Data

The data should be placed in your project folder so that it is easy for the code to find. We will then read in the data using the `read_csv()` function.

```{r}
profile <- read_csv("SR04.csv")
```

The object `profile` is now a data frame containing the data in `SR04.csv`. It should be available to you in the environment panel where you can click on it to see it in spreadsheet format.

Some things to note about the data from a quick-look:

* The data is already tidy - each row is an observation and each column is a variable.

* The rows are observations at particular depths (z)

* The columns have relatively self-explanatory headings, but we always need the metadata that tells us what each is specifically. In our case:
    + Cruise: Unique identifier for the cruise (oceanographic expedition) on which the data was gathered - there are five different cruises in this data
    + Station: Unique station number (i.e. ID of location where the ship stopped to take the measurements)
    + lon: Longitude (decimal degrees east)
    + lat: Latitude (decimal degrees north)
    + z: Depth (m)
    + pres: Pressure (dbar)
    + temp: Temperature (째C)
    + sal: Salinity
    + theta: Potential Temperature (째C) - the temperature the water would be if it was raised to the surface. This accounts for the slight cooling effect of increased pressure
    + sigma: Potential Density (kgm^-^3)  

### Plotting

Recall from what you've already seen that we create a simple ggplot using the following template:

```{r template, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

Where we will need to specify three things:

1. `<DATA>` The data frame used to make the plot
1. `<MAPPINGS>` The mapping of variables to aesthetics - what variable you want to put on thew x axis, y axis, color axis, etc.
1. '<GEOM_FUNCTION>' A geom to represent these aesthetics - how will this look? (points? lines?)

So, as a first example, we can plot the temperature data over depth in the following way:

```{r}
ggplot(data = profile) +
  geom_line(aes(x = z, y = temp))
```

Where we have specified that:

1. Our data is contained in the data frame, `profile`
1. We want to map depth (z) to position along the x axis and temperature (temp) to position along the y axis
1. We want the representation to be a line `geom_line()`

*ASIDE: This is the most verbose way I can write this. Verbose in coding means more explicit or using-lots-of-typing. I have used `data = profiles`, `x = dttm` and `y = temp`. As with many functions in R, both `ggplot()` and `aes()` are expecting certain inputs and instead of officially declaring them, you can just write them in the right order. The above code could be written more succinctly as:*


```{r, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
ggplot(profile) +
  geom_line(aes(z, temp))
```

*We've lost something in the ability for us to directly interpret what is being assigned to what, but we're saving our fingers in the long run. It's up to you which makes more sense to you at this point.*

The above figure is what you would plot from a traditional science perspective - the independent variable (z) is on the x axis and the dependent variable (temperature) is on the y axis. However, from an oceanography perspective, it makes more sense to have depth be on the y axis and temperature on the x axis. Like this (flipping the positon of z and temp):

```{r}
ggplot(profile) +
  geom_line(aes(temp, z))
```

Uh oh. What a mess. What's happening here? ggplot actually has two geoms that can draw lines. We've been using `geom_line()` so far, but underneath the hood, this function actually sorts the y variable along the x axis. This can be useful in many cases were data is not sorted already, but in our case it means that the nice sweeping curve gets deconstructed. For our purposes, we're going to want to use `geom_path()` which joins the data up in the order they appear in the data set.

```{r}
ggplot(profile) +
  geom_path(aes(temp, z))
```

The last thing we're going to do to fit with oceanographic norms is to flip the y axis. This will make depth be greater the further you go down the plot.

Doing this in ggplot requires us to use one of the `scale_*` functions. These functions basically say: *Take the mapping we've already set up in out ggplot and adjust how the data is mapped*. This includes telling ggplot what range of values to map to our x axis, whether we want a log axis, what colors to map our data to, and, in our case, what direction to plot the data in. We'll talk more about the `scale_*` functions in Level 3 if you are interested.

```{r}
ggplot(profile) +
  geom_path(aes(temp, z)) +
  scale_y_reverse()
```

So now we have an intuitive way to look at the data. The temperature is around -1.8째C at the surface (top) and increases to a maximum of 2째C at around 300 m before slowly cooling again as you head deeper.

I've zipped a [project file here](Viz_L2_example.zip) that contains the data and the code you would need to run the above visualization. Unzip the folder and double-click on the Viz_L2_example.Rproj file to open this project in RStudio. 

## Exercise

Working together as a group, our goal is to help each of you able to read in data from our cruise and make some basic plots to analyze. The above tools and walk-through gives you a good starting point, but there are probably many diverging goals and we will have to work some things out as we go.

To get signed off at Level 2, you will need to be able to show me an RStudio project that contains the data and a script that:

* Activates the appropriate libraries
* Loads in at least one of the cruise datasets
* Makes at least one plot with relevant axes and an appropriate geoms
* Has comments that describe what each section of code is doing

I can come see this on your computer or you can zip the project folder and submit to the assignment on Google Classroom below.

<p>Now that we have a little theory behind us, we’re going to look at some of the tools in R that allow us to make figures that will look really good on our poster and other publications.</p>
<p>Again, RStudio has a <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3.8">nice primer</a> for how to customize your plots including how to zoom in, add labels, add a theme, and scale your color axis.</p>
<p>You should go through this primer and run the code chunks as you go to make sure you understand it.</p>
<div id="exercise" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the information in the primer above, you should apply these tools to one of your visualizations.</p>
<p>Pick a figure you have made in R and improve it by showing me at least <strong>two</strong> design tools in actions. This could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a theme</li>
<li>Adding labels or annotations</li>
<li>Zooming in</li>
<li>Changing colors</li>
<li>Adapting the theme</li>
<li>Changing tick locations and labels</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have done this, you should submit the following to the assignment below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your script</li>
<li>Your figure (can take screen shot or use ggsave() function)</li>
<li>A brief description of the changes you made and why you think this improves the design of your figure in relation to what you read in level 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you’ve got a good sense of your main results and possible text, it’s time to think about how you want to present that information in your poster.</p>
<p>Making an effective research poster is not easy, especially for a scientist without any graphic design training. To prepare for the making and presenting of your research posters, we are going to discuss some best practices in graphic design.</p>
<p>To be able to discuss poster design with some theory in mind, I’d like you to read the following resources which talk about graphic design principals:</p>

<p>Please take some notes as you read on points that speak to effective poster design.</p>
<p>In class, we’re going to apply some of the design ideas from above to scientific posters more specifically.</p>
<p>Below are some poster examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="posters/poster1.jpg">Poster 1</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster2.pdf">Poster 2</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster3.pdf">Poster 3</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster4.jpg">Poster 4</a></li>
<li><a href="posters/poster5.pdf">Poster 5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We will assign these posters in class to small group discussions where we will think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the audience for this poster?</li>
<li>How easy was it to get the general message? Why?</li>
<li>What design elements were effective?</li>
<li>What design elements were ineffective?</li>
</ul>
<p>FYI - here are a selection of previous PEP posters:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="pep_posters/geology.pdf">Geology</a></li>

Making an effective research poster is not easy, especially for a scientist without any graphic design training. To prepare for the making and presenting of your research posters, we are going to discuss some best practices in graphic design.

To be able to discuss poster design with some theory in mind, I'd like you to read the following resources which talk about graphic design principals:

In class, we're going to apply some of the design ideas from above to scientific posters more specifically.

<p>Scientific papers are technical documents written by, and for, scientists in a particular field documenting the research they undertook and the results and conclusions they arrived at.</p>
<p>They can be daunting to read and no one is recommending you start at the beginning and slog your way to the end. The key thing is to know <em>why</em> you are reading the paper in the first place. Have a goal in mind that will help you focus on a particular section or message.</p>
<p>You could be reading the paper because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You want to find out the importance of the field or want to know what is currently known about the topic (most of which can be found in the introduction)</p></li>
<li><p>You are looking for more similar papers to give you an overview of the field (also the introduction)</p></li>
<li><p>You want a quick look at the what they found (abstract, conclusions)</p></li>
<li><p>You need to check or reproduce a method (methods)</p></li>
<li><p>You want to scrutinize the data they are presenting or understand it for use in another project (results)</p></li>
<li><p>You want want to understand where the unknowns in the field are (introduction, discussion)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This level contains a selection of resources to help you to read scientific papers that will be useful to your project. Another big resource will be your peers - many of you will have skills and specific tricks on this so I encourage you to share with each other.</p>

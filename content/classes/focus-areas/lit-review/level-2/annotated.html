<p>We should have a pretty good idea now how to read a paper and some general insight into how and where to find additional ones.</p>
<p>Your goal now is to build an annotated bibliography for your research project that helps you understand what is known and see opportunities where you can contribute to scientific understanding.</p>
<p>An annotated bibliography is a list of well formatted references to specific papers with a few of sentences after each that describe what the paper showed and what relevance it has to your project. An example can be seen <a href="">here</a>. Keeping track of what your reading and what it teaches you is an essential skill of a research scientist. There is even software that can help you keepo track of things digitally (e.g. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>)</p>
<p>In the above example, each paper is referenced in a similar format. You may come across a number of different formats in your searches or in your previous experiences: each field/journal does things slightly different. For the sake of this project, we’re going to use the format used by the <a href="https://www.agu.org/Publish-with-AGU/Publish/Author-Resources/Grammar-Style-Guide#referenceformat">American Geophysical Union</a>:</p>
<p>Quoting from their site, the format it:</p>
<p>Author, A. A., Author, B. B., &amp; Author, C. C. (year). Title of article. <em>Title of periodical, xx(x)</em>, pp-pp. <a href="https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxxxxx" class="uri">https://doi.org/xx.xxxx/xxxxxxxx</a></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Title of periodical</em> is the journal name</li>
<li><em>xx(x)</em> is the volume (and issue) number</li>
<li>pp-pp is the page range</li>
<li>The doi hyperlink is a universal reference link to the paper. All papers now have a DOI and should be included in the reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>Deng, A., &amp; Stauffer, D. R. (2006). On improving 4-km mesoscale model simulations. <em>Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, 45(3)</em>, 361–381. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/JAM2341.1" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1175/JAM2341.1</a></p>
<p>Wang, C. (2005). A modeling study of the response of tropical deep convection to the increase of cloud condensational nuclei concentration: 1. Dynamics and microphysics. <em>Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 110</em>, D21211. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2004JD005720" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1029/2004JD005720</a></p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>You can complete this work in your research topic teams and share resource, but you will need to submit your own work including finding some (but not all) unique papers.</p>
<p>You need to use your searching and reading skills to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a goal sentence - what are you wanting to find out from your papers?</li>
<li>Find 4-6 papers that help you reach that goal in the region of interest. At least two should be unique from your peers.</li>
<li>Read the as much of the papers as you need to reach your stated goal</li>
<li>Create a list of properly formatted references to the papers</li>
<li>Write 2 or 3 sentences after each describing what the paper shows and how it is useful to your project</li>
</ul>

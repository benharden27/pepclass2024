<p>You’ve got the point where you can search for and extract information from papers. On this level we’re going to take our understanding a little deeper by connecting and synthesizing your bibliography.</p>
<div id="expanding-your-bibliography" class="section level2">
<h2>Expanding your bibliography</h2>
<p>To start with, you should extend your annotated bibliography to 6-8 entries so you encompass a more thorough range or sources.</p>

<h2>Mapping your bibliography</h2>
<p>Now that you have an expanded bibliography, we’re going to deepen out analysis of how each paper fills in a piece of the scientific picture of your topic.</p>
<p>Scientists do this in all kinds of different ways, but a typical tool that is helpful is a <a href="https://mind-map.com/learn-how-to-mind-map/">mind map</a>. The goal here is to visually represent the different factors/considerations that affect your chosen topic area. We can then match up what is known to the papers that show us that, and, importantly, find gaps in our understanding that we can fill.</p>
<p>To complete this level you will need to make your own mind map of your topic and document how you revised it to find new papers or highlight gaps in understanding.</p>
<p>You should start with your research topic in the center of your map. Include both your topic and the region of interest. This is probably going to be something like: “Nutrient availability in Rhode Island Sound”.</p>
<p>You can then build our 3-5 factors that impact that. These could include: “local environment”, “seasonality”, “theoretical underpinning”, “why should care?”. Allow your bibliography to lead the generation of these categories.</p>
<p>Under each of these branches you can then start organizing what is known and, importantly, which reference in your bibliography tells you that. If you find yourself in a position where you are making a statement about something you know without a paper on your bibliography to back that up then you should go find a source for that information and add it in.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you find yourself asking any questions about your topic, then this is a good chance to find resources that may answer those questions. If none can be found then you’ve highlighted a gap in understanding - really the ultimate goal of any background review.</p>
<p>You can do this by hand or on a Google Slide. If you’re looking for inspiration then there are tons of ideas out there on Google. Once you’ve taken a first pass at this mind map, I’ll give you some feedback and you can revise/extend that map to create a well-rounded picture of your topic.</p>
